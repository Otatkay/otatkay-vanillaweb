Hello, thanks to propose your help.

Actually, you will find here code samples ready to be deployed on Azure (or any other cloud provider, I believe).

You can propose any modification in the code, as long as you ensure the coverage by Junit tests, and that the existing tests still pass.
Note that committing on master is forbiddent, please push on your own branch/fork then create a PR to promote your code to master.

Thanks
